# Amazon-Sales-Data-Pipeline-Project
This project is designed to process Amazon sales data for mobile phones over the span of a year. The pipeline ingests data in CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats using Apache Airflow and processes it through a series of stages in Snowflake before visualizing the output in a dashboard.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Apache Airflow:** Orchestrating and scheduling data pipeline tasks.
- **Snowflake:** Storing and processing data in internal staging, source, curated, and consumption zones.
- **Snowpark:** Data transformation and computation in Snowflake.
- **Dashboard Tool:** Visualizing data (mention the specific tool you used).
