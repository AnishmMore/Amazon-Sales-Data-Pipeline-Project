# Amazon-Sales-Data-Pipeline-Project
This project is designed to process Amazon sales data for mobile phones over the span of a year. The pipeline ingests data in CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats using Apache Airflow and processes it through a series of stages in Snowflake before visualizing the output in a dashboard.
